# odata-filter-parser

Library for parsing and building and parsing OData filter strings.  Only compatible with a subset of functions defined in OData specification

* Supports OData specification V2 through V4 (partially)

## Using the Library
Full API documentation and examples is available on the [Documentation](https://github.com/jadrake75/odata-filter-parser/blob/master/doc/Intro.md) page.

To include the library in your application, you can either reference the `.js` files under the `dist` folder or use the JSPM / Node 
modular inclusion discussed on the [Documentation](https://github.com/jadrake75/odata-filter-parser/blob/master/doc/Intro.md) page.

## Including the Library with Aurelia CLI
The new Aurelia CLI will have difficulty resolving the dependencies from the require statements and try and resolve odata-filter under src vs the distribution folder.  To resolve this, 
use the following configuration in the dependencies section of the aurelia.json file:
   
  ```
  {
     "name": "odata-filter-parser",
     "path": "../node_modules/odata-filter-parser",
     "main": "index"
  }
  ```
   
## Dependencies
This library has *no* third-party dependencies (outside of testing and building tools used by source).  No additional software is required.

## Platform Support
This library should work on all modern browsers that support HTML-5 EcmaScript 5 standard as well as V8 (used by NodeJS).

## Building The Library
To build the code, follow these steps.

  * Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) is installed.  This provides the platform on which the build tooling is run.
  * From the project folder, executue the following command:
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  * Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) is installed.  If you need to install it, use the following command (however 
  running `npm install` above should have installed a local copy):
  
  ```
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
  * To build the code, you can not run:
  
  ```
  gulp
  ```
  * You will find the built code under the `dist` folder.
  * See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to the generating of the library.

## Running Tests

To execute the tests with jest simply run

```
npm test
```

This will generate coverage information automatically.


## Submission Guidelines
Pull-Requests will be used for accepting bug fixes or feature requests, however please contact the owner prior to proposing
a pull-request for non-bug fixes to avoid unnecessary work and effort.  All submissions should provide test coverage and
conform with the eslint standards defined in the `.eslintrc` file.

## Deployment Information

To deploy the module to npm use the following command (user access will be required)

```
npm publish
```
